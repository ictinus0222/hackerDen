# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Collaborative Documents feature will enable team members to create, edit, and collaborate on markdown documents in real-time within their hackathon teams. This feature extends HackerDen's collaboration capabilities by providing a shared workspace for documentation, planning, brainstorming, and knowledge sharing. Documents will support full markdown syntax, real-time collaborative editing, version history, and seamless integration with the existing team-based architecture.
