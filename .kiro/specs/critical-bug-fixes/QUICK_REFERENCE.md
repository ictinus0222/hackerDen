## 🧪 Quick Test (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Test File Download
- Upload a file to vault
- Download it
- Verify it opens correctly

# 2. Test Timeline
- Check hackathon status badges
- Should show: upcoming/ongoing/completed

# 3. Test Team Names
- Open team members list
- All names should be visible (not "Team Member")

# 4. Test Submissions
- Create/update a submission
- Should work smoothly with clear errors
```

## 🔧 Migration Utility (if needed)

If team member names still show as "Team Member":

```javascript
// In browser console on any team page:
import { teamMemberNameFixer } from './src/utils/teamMemberNameFixer.js';
import { useAuth } from './src/hooks/useAuth.jsx';

const { user } = useAuth();
await teamMemberNameFixer.fixAllUserTeamNames(user);
```

## 📊 What Changed?

### File Download
**Before**: Complex fetch logic, compression issues
**After**: Simple direct download, preserves integrity

### Timeline
**Before**: Flickering, wrong statuses
**After**: Stable, accurate status display

### Team Names
**Before**: Everyone shows as "Team Member"
**After**: Actual names displayed

### Submissions
**Before**: Unclear errors, inconsistent validation
**After**: Clear messages, reliable validation

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues

1. **Team Names**: May need migration for existing teams
2. **Timeline**: 1-minute buffer delays status changes
3. **Downloads**: Depends on browser settings

## 🚨 Rollback
