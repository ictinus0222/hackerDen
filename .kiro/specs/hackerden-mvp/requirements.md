# Requirements Document

## Introduction

HackerDen MVP is a streamlined team collaboration platform focused on the essential "core loop" of hackathon teams: creating/joining teams, managing tasks visually, and communicating in real-time. This MVP deliberately defers advanced features like file management, secrets, and PWA capabilities to focus on delivering a rock-solid foundation for the hackathon submission.

The core value proposition is enabling hackathon teams to collaborate effectively through three integrated features: team management, Kanban task boards, and real-time chat, all built on React + Appwrite for rapid development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Team Creation and Join System

**User Story:** As a hackathon participant, I want to create or join a team using a simple code system, so that I can quickly form collaborations with other participants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers and has no team THEN the system SHALL display team creation and join options
2. WHEN a user creates a team THEN the system SHALL generate a unique join code and make the user the team owner
3. WHEN a user enters a valid join code THEN the system SHALL add them to that team and redirect to the dashboard
4. WHEN a user is already part of a team THEN the system SHALL redirect them directly to the team dashboard
5. IF a user enters an invalid join code THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow retry

### Requirement 2: Unified Project Dashboard

**User Story:** As a team member, I want a single dashboard that shows our Kanban board and chat side-by-side, so that I can see all team activity at a glance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a team member accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display the Kanban board and chat in a responsive layout
2. WHEN viewed on desktop THEN the system SHALL show Kanban and chat side-by-side
3. WHEN viewed on mobile THEN the system SHALL allow switching between Kanban and chat views
4. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL fetch and display current team data in real-time

### Requirement 3: Kanban Task Management

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to create, view, and move tasks through workflow stages on a visual board, so that our team can track progress and coordinate work effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Kanban board loads THEN the system SHALL display four columns: To-Do, In Progress, Blocked, and Done
2. WHEN a user creates a task THEN the system SHALL add it to the To-Do column and sync across all team members
3. WHEN a user drags a task to a different column THEN the system SHALL update the task status and sync the change in real-time
4. WHEN a task is moved THEN the system SHALL post an automated message in chat about the status change
5. WHEN a task is created THEN the system SHALL post an automated message in chat about the new task
6. IF a user tries to create a task without required fields THEN the system SHALL display validation errors

### Requirement 4: Real-Time Team Chat

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to send and receive messages instantly with my team, so that we can coordinate quickly and share updates during our hackathon work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chat loads THEN the system SHALL display existing team messages in chronological order
2. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL immediately display it to all online team members
3. WHEN a new message arrives THEN the system SHALL display it without requiring page refresh
4. WHEN a user types a message THEN the system SHALL validate it's not empty before allowing send
5. WHEN automated task updates occur THEN the system SHALL post system messages to the chat

### Requirement 5: Real-Time Synchronization

**User Story:** As a team member, I want all changes to tasks and messages to appear instantly for everyone, so that our team stays coordinated without confusion or delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any team member makes a change THEN the system SHALL sync that change to all other team members within 2 seconds
2. WHEN a user's connection is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically sync any missed updates
3. WHEN multiple users edit simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle conflicts gracefully using Appwrite's built-in conflict resolution
4. IF the real-time connection fails THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically

### Requirement 6: Mobile-Responsive Interface

**User Story:** As a team member using mobile devices, I want the interface to be usable and clean on smaller screens, so that I can participate effectively regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display a responsive layout that fits the screen
2. WHEN on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide easy navigation between Kanban and chat views
3. WHEN interacting with tasks on mobile THEN the system SHALL support touch-based drag and drop or alternative interaction methods
4. WHEN typing messages on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide an optimized input experience with proper keyboard handling
5. WHEN using touch interactions THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate touch targets and feedback
