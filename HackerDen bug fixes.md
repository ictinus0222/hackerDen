Okay so these are some Bugs that I found and need to get them out before Submitting them to the hackathon.

## 1. Refresh Glitch
I found that anytime I refresh the page, The website brings me back to the authentication screen and i have to navigate to the page where I was earlier, again, Everytime!
## 2. User Console
I found out that the status indicator of a hackathon where it should tell if the hackathon was from past, Ongoing or upcoming, all the hackathons are labelled as upcoming. Regardless of the dates I set, It always shows upcoming. and the date format should be DD/MM/YYYY instead of MM/DD/YYYY. And on the hackathon card, The leader should should have the Leader batch instead of the Member. and I also want the team Avatar to use shad cn avatar to keep it consistent with the dark black/orange theme.
## 3. BreadCrumbs
The bread crumb of an individual hackathon should not be just "Hackathon", I should be the hackathon's name.
## 4. Team Member's Name Issues
One thing I noticed that I can only My name and the Team Leader's name in the Team Members widget, all the other members are named as Team Member. and their online status is not accurate, It says Online even when the person is not online. 
## 5. Tasks Tab
The only problem here is that there should be no WIP limit for any board, I can see that the In progress has a limit of 3 and blocked has a limit of 2, so remove them. 
## 6. Collaborative Document.
This says that it supports markdown, but it doesn't do the markdown stuff which makes it a bit difficult to work on, also the syncing while multiple people type is off. and I want it to properly support markdown.
## 7. Team Chat
The span element below the Team Chat Heading which says 'Current Hackathon' should say the hackathon name. and also, The system Messages which says 'System completed task: {Task name}' It should be "{Team Member's Name} completed task: {Task Name}" where Team Member's name is the name of the member to whom the task was assigned. Next, the System Message "System changed task "Team Chat Integration" from todo to in_progress" here replace the "todo" and "in_progress" with their actual column names "TO-DO" and "In Progress" respectively.

## 8. DataBase Schema
analyse the whole project, and give me all the collections and attributes that are required in the database.also their details like size, and other thinngs
