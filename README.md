## Dashboard Layout

### Responsive Design
The dashboard implements a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes:

- **Desktop (lg+)**: Side-by-side layout with Kanban board and Chat components
- **Mobile/Tablet**: Tab-based interface allowing users to switch between Kanban and Chat views
- **Loading States**: Contextual loading spinners with descriptive messages
- **Error Handling**: Error boundaries that gracefully handle crashes with recovery options

### Layout Components

#### Layout Component
- **Header**: Contains app branding and user information with logout functionality
- **Main Content Area**: Responsive container for dashboard content
- **Navigation**: User-friendly navigation with proper spacing and styling

#### MobileTabSwitcher
- **Tab Navigation**: Clean tab interface for mobile users
- **Active States**: Visual indicators for the currently selected tab
- **Smooth Transitions**: Seamless switching between Kanban and Chat views

#### Error Boundary
- **Crash Protection**: Catches JavaScript errors in child components
- **Recovery Options**: Provides users with options to refresh and recover
- **Error Logging**: Logs errors to console for debugging purposes

#### Loading States
- **Contextual Messages**: Different loading messages based on the operation
- **Visual Feedback**: Animated spinners with consistent styling
- **User Experience**: Prevents confusion during data loading

### Team Dashboard Features
- **Team Information Header**: Displays team name, join code, and active status
- **Responsive Grid**: Automatically adjusts layout based on screen size
- **Component Placeholders**: Ready for Kanban and Chat implementation
- **Consistent Styling**: Uses Tailwind CSS for consistent design language

## Team Management Flow

### Team Routing Logic
The application implements smart routing based on user team membership:

- **Users with Teams**: Automatically redirected to team dashboard showing team information
- **Users without Teams**: Presented with team selection options (create or join)
- **Context-Aware Navigation**: Team state is managed globally and shared across components

### Team Creation Flow

1. **Registration/Login**: Users authenticate via email/password
2. **Team Selection**: Users without teams see the TeamSelector component
3. **Team Creation**: Users can create a new team with a unique name
4. **Join Code Generation**: System generates a 6-character alphanumeric join code
5. **Team Ownership**: Creator becomes team owner with full permissions
6. **Code Sharing**: Join code can be copied and shared with team members

### Team Joining Flow

1. **Join Code Entry**: Users enter a 6-character join code
2. **Code Validation**: System validates code format and existence
3. **Membership Check**: Prevents duplicate team memberships
4. **Team Assignment**: User is added as a team member
5. **Dashboard Redirect**: Automatic redirect to team dashboard

### Team Management Features
- **Smart Routing**: Automatic navigation based on team membership status
- **Team Context**: Global team state management with React Context
- **Form Validation**: Comprehensive validation for team names and join codes
- **Unique Join Code Generation**: Excludes confusing characters (0, O, I, 1)
- **Real-time Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages and loading states
- **Copy-to-Clipboard**: Join code sharing with visual feedback
- **Membership Management**: Automatic team membership creation and validation

## Task Management System

### Kanban Board Features
- **Four-Column Layout**: To-Do, In Progress, Blocked, Done columns
- **Real-time Updates**: Live task synchronization across all team members
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts from single column (mobile) to four columns (desktop)
- **Task Creation**: Modal-based task creation with comprehensive form validation
- **Status Management**: Visual organization of tasks by current status
- **Team Filtering**: Automatic filtering of tasks by current team

### Task Creation Flow
1. **Access**: Click "Create Task" button on the Kanban board
2. **Form**: Fill out task title and description (both required)
3. **Validation**: Real-time form validation with error feedback
4. **Creation**: Task is created with 'todo' status and assigned to current user
5. **Real-time Update**: New task appears immediately for all team members

### Task Management Features
- **Form Validation**: Required field validation for title and description
- **Auto-Assignment**: New tasks are automatically assigned to the creator
- **Status Tracking**: Tasks are organized by status (todo, in_progress, blocked, done)
- **Real-time Sync**: Changes appear instantly across all team member devices
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management with user-friendly messages
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during task operations

## Architecture Components

### Context Providers
- **AuthContext**: Manages user authentication state and methods
- **TeamContext**: Manages team membership state and team operations

### Custom Hooks
- **useAuth**: Provides access to authentication context and methods
- **useTeam**: Provides access to team context, membership status, and team operations

### Key Components
- **TeamSelector**: Displays create/join options for users without teams
- **ProtectedRoute**: Ensures authenticated access to protected pages
- **Dashboard**: Smart dashboard that adapts based on team membership

### Routing Strategy
The application uses conditional routing based on team membership:
```javascript
// Users with teams see team dashboard
{hasTeam ? <TeamDashboard /> : <TeamSelector />}
```

### Team Context API
The `useTeam` hook provides the following methods and state:

```javascript
const {
  team,           // Current user's team object (null if no team)
  loading,        // Loading state for team operations
  error,          // Error message from team operations
  hasTeam,        // Boolean indicating if user has a team
  createTeam,     // Function to create a new team
  joinTeam,       // Function to join a team by code
  refreshTeam     // Function to refresh team data
} = useTeam();
```
