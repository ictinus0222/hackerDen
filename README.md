```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd hackerden
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
Copy the example environment file and add your credentials:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` with your actual Appwrite credentials:
```env
# Core Appwrite Configuration
VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=your-database-id

## Architecture Components

### Context Providers
- **AuthContext**: Manages user authentication state and methods
- **TeamContext**: Manages team membership state and team operations

### Custom Hooks
- **useAuth**: Provides access to authentication context and methods
- **useTeam**: Provides access to team context, membership status, and team operations

### Key Components
- **TeamSelector**: Displays create/join options for users without teams
- **ProtectedRoute**: Ensures authenticated access to protected pages
- **Dashboard**: Smart dashboard that adapts based on team membership

### Routing Strategy
The application uses conditional routing based on team membership:
```javascript
// Users with teams see team dashboard
{hasTeam ? <TeamDashboard /> : <TeamSelector />}
```

### Team Context API
The `useTeam` hook provides the following methods and state:

```javascript
const {
  team,           // Current user's team object (null if no team)
  loading,        // Loading state for team operations
  error,          // Error message from team operations
  hasTeam,        // Boolean indicating if user has a team
  createTeam,     // Function to create a new team
  joinTeam,       // Function to join a team by code
  refreshTeam     // Function to refresh team data
} = useTeam();
```
