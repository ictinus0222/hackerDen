## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Appwrite instance (cloud or self-hosted)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd hackerden
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
Copy the example environment file and configure your Appwrite credentials:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your Appwrite project details:
```env
# Core Appwrite Configuration (Required)
VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=your-database-id

# Server API Key (Required for setup scripts)
APPWRITE_API_KEY=your-server-api-key

# Public URL Configuration (Required for production)
# Set this to your production domain for correct submission URLs and OAuth callbacks
VITE_PUBLIC_URL=https://hackerden.netlify.app

# Enhancement Feature Flags (Optional)
VITE_ENABLE_FILE_SHARING=true
VITE_ENABLE_ANIMATIONS=true
```

**Security Note**: Never commit `.env` to version control. It's automatically ignored by git.

4. **Set up Appwrite backend:**
Create the required database collections and storage buckets:
```bash
# Set up core MVP collections (teams, tasks, messages, etc.)
# Follow the guide in docs/appwrite-setup.md

# Set up enhancement collections and storage buckets
npm run setup:enhancements

# Verify database schema
npm run validate:schema

# Test database connectivity
npm run test:database
```

5. **Verify installation:**
Run tests to ensure everything is working correctly:
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:run

# Test enhancement services specifically
npm run test:run -- src/services/__tests__/enhancementServices.test.js

# Test UI components
npm run test:run -- src/components/__tests__/
```

6. **Start development server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` with hot module replacement enabled.

### Quick Start Guide

1. **Register an account** at `/register`
2. **Create or join a hackathon** from the console
3. **Create or join a team** using the team selector
4. **Start collaborating** with tasks, chat, and enhancement features

### Troubleshooting Installation

**Common Issues:**
- **Appwrite connection errors**: Verify your endpoint and project ID
- **Permission errors**: Ensure your API key has database and storage permissions
- **Setup script failures**: Check that your database exists in Appwrite Console
- **Missing collections**: Run `npm run setup:enhancements` to create required collections

**Getting Help:**
- Check `docs/enhancement-setup-guide.md` for detailed setup instructions
- Review `docs/troubleshooting-*.md` files for specific issues
- Ensure Node.js version 18+ is installed
- Verify npm dependencies are correctly installed

## Architecture Components

### Context Providers
- **AuthContext**: Manages user authentication state and methods
- **TeamContext**: Manages team membership state and team operations

### Custom Hooks
- **useAuth**: Provides access to authentication context and methods
- **useTeam**: Provides access to team context, membership status, and team operations

### Key Components
- **TeamSelector**: Displays create/join options for users without teams
- **ProtectedRoute**: Ensures authenticated access to protected pages
- **Dashboard**: Smart dashboard that adapts based on team membership

### Routing Strategy
The application uses conditional routing based on team membership:
```javascript
// Users with teams see team dashboard
{hasTeam ? <TeamDashboard /> : <TeamSelector />}
```

### Team Context API
The `useTeam` hook provides the following methods and state:

```javascript
const {
  team,           // Current user's team object (null if no team)
  loading,        // Loading state for team operations
  error,          // Error message from team operations
  hasTeam,        // Boolean indicating if user has a team
  createTeam,     // Function to create a new team
  joinTeam,       // Function to join a team by code
  refreshTeam     // Function to refresh team data
} = useTeam();
```
