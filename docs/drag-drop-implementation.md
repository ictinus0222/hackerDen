# Drag and Drop Implementation

## Overview

The Kanban board now supports full drag-and-drop functionality for moving tasks between columns. This implementation includes both desktop (mouse) and mobile (touch) support with visual feedback and real-time synchronization. The code has been formatted and optimized by the IDE autofix system.

## Features Implemented

### 1. HTML5 Drag and Drop API
- Tasks are draggable using the native HTML5 drag and drop API
- Proper data transfer handling with task IDs
- Custom drag images for better visual feedback

### 2. Touch Support for Mobile
- Custom touch drag and drop implementation using `useTouchDragDrop` hook
- Touch-specific visual feedback and drag previews
- Proper touch event handling to prevent scrolling during drag

### 3. Visual Feedback
- Dragged tasks become semi-transparent and slightly rotated
- Drop zones highlight when dragged over (blue dashed border)
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Different visual states for desktop and mobile

### 4. Real-time Synchronization
- Task status updates are immediately synced to Appwrite database
- Real-time subscriptions ensure all connected clients see changes within 2 seconds
- Optimistic updates for better user experience

## Components Modified

### TaskCard.jsx
- Added `draggable` attribute and drag event handlers (`handleDragStart`, `handleTouchStart`)
- Implemented touch event handlers for mobile support (`onTouchStart`, `onTouchMove`, `onTouchEnd`)
- Added visual feedback classes for drag states (`.dragging` class applied when `isDragging` is true)
- Custom drag image creation for better UX with rotation and opacity effects
- Proper event handling with data transfer API for task IDs

### TaskColumn.jsx
- Added drop zone functionality with comprehensive event handlers:
  - `handleDragOver`: Prevents default and sets visual feedback
  - `handleDragEnter`: Manages drag enter state
  - `handleDragLeave`: Handles drag leave with proper boundary checking
  - `handleDrop`: Processes the drop event and triggers task update
- Visual feedback for drag over states with blue dashed border and shadow
- Touch drop zone support with `data-drop-zone` attributes
- Dynamic text feedback ("Drop task in [Column]" vs "No tasks in [column]")
- Proper event prevention and cleanup

### KanbanBoard.jsx
- Central drag and drop logic coordination with state management
- Integration with `taskService.updateTaskStatus` for database updates
- Touch drag and drop hook integration via `useTouchDragDrop`
- Loading states during task updates (`isUpdatingTask` state)
- Comprehensive logging for debugging drag operations
- Dynamic CSS injection for touch drag feedback
- Unified dragging state management for both mouse and touch interactions

### useTouchDragDrop.jsx (New Hook)
- Custom hook for touch-based drag and drop with complete state management
- Drag preview creation and real-time positioning during touch move
- Touch event handling with proper cleanup and state management
- Visual feedback management for touch interactions with CSS class manipulation
- Proper touch offset calculation for accurate drag positioning
- Element detection under touch point for drop zone identification

## CSS Styles Added

```css
/* Drag and Drop Styles */
.drag-preview {
  position: fixed;
  pointer-events: none;
  z-index: 9999;
  opacity: 0.8;
  transform: rotate(5deg) scale(1.05);
  box-shadow: 0 10px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
}

.dragging {
  opacity: 0.5;
  transform: rotate(2deg) scale(1.05);
}

.drag-over {
  background-color: rgb(219 234 254) !important;
  border-color: rgb(59 130 246) !important;
  border-width: 2px !important;
  border-style: dashed !important;
}

.touch-manipulation {
  touch-action: none;
}
```

## Usage

### Desktop (Mouse)
1. Click and hold on any task card
2. Drag the task to the desired column
3. Release the mouse button to drop
4. The task will update its status and sync in real-time

### Mobile (Touch)
1. Touch and hold on any task card
2. Drag the task to the desired column
3. Release touch to drop
4. Visual feedback shows drag preview and drop zones

## Technical Details

### Event Flow

#### Desktop (Mouse) Drag and Drop:
1. **Drag Start**: 
   - `handleDragStart` is triggered on TaskCard
   - Task ID is stored in `e.dataTransfer` with `setData('text/plain', task.$id)`
   - Custom drag image is created and applied
   - `onDragStart` callback updates `draggingTask` state in KanbanBoard
   - Visual feedback begins (task becomes semi-transparent and rotated)

2. **Drag Over**: 
   - `handleDragOver` prevents default browser behavior
   - Drop zones highlight with blue dashed border and shadow
   - `isDragOver` state is managed per column

3. **Drop**: 
   - `handleDrop` retrieves task ID from `e.dataTransfer.getData('text/plain')`
   - Task status update is triggered via `handleTaskDrop`
   - Visual feedback is cleaned up

4. **Database Update**: 
   - `taskService.updateTaskStatus` updates Appwrite document
   - `isUpdatingTask` state provides loading feedback
   - Error handling with console logging

5. **Real-time Sync**: 
   - Appwrite real-time subscriptions in `useTasks` hook
   - All connected clients receive updates within 2 seconds

#### Touch Drag and Drop:
1. **Touch Start**: 
   - `handleTouchStart` captures touch coordinates and creates drag preview
   - Touch offset is calculated for accurate positioning
   - Scrolling is prevented with `e.preventDefault()`

2. **Touch Move**: 
   - `handleTouchMove` updates drag preview position in real-time
   - Element detection under touch point identifies drop zones
   - Visual feedback is applied via CSS class manipulation

3. **Touch End**: 
   - `handleTouchEnd` determines final drop zone
   - Task status update is triggered if valid drop zone is found
   - All visual feedback and drag preview are cleaned up

### Error Handling
- Failed status updates are logged with detailed error information
- Invalid drops (same column) are detected and ignored with logging
- Network errors are handled gracefully without breaking the UI
- Missing tasks are detected and logged as errors
- Touch event errors are prevented with proper null checks

### Performance Considerations
- Drag operations use efficient state management to prevent excessive re-renders
- Visual feedback uses CSS transforms and transitions for smooth animations
- Touch events properly prevent scrolling during drag operations with `touch-action: none`
- Drag preview cleanup is handled automatically to prevent memory leaks
- Event listeners are properly managed with useCallback hooks
- Database updates are optimized with single API calls per drop operation

## Testing

Manual testing scenarios are available in `src/components/__tests__/dragDrop.test.js`:

1. **Basic Drag and Drop**: Move tasks between columns
2. **Touch Drag and Drop**: Test mobile functionality
3. **Visual Feedback**: Verify proper visual states
4. **Cross-Column Movement**: Test all column combinations
5. **Real-time Synchronization**: Multi-tab testing

## Requirements Satisfied

- ✅ **3.3**: Tasks can be moved between columns via drag and drop
- ✅ **5.1**: Changes sync in real-time across all team members
- ✅ **6.3**: Touch-based drag and drop works on mobile devices
