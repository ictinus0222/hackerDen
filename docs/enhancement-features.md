3. Node.js environment with npm

### Setup Process
```bash
# Install enhancement dependencies
npm install

# Set up enhancement collections and storage
npm run setup:enhancements

# Verify setup with tests
npm run test:run -- src/services/__tests__/enhancementServices.test.js

# Start development with enhancements enabled
npm run dev
```

### Configuration
Add to your `.env` file:
```env
# Required for enhancement setup
APPWRITE_API_KEY=your-server-api-key

# Optional enhancement settings
VITE_ENABLE_SOUND_EFFECTS=true
VITE_ENABLE_ANIMATIONS=true
VITE_BOT_PERSONALITY=friendly
```

## Best Practices

### Development Guidelines
1. **shadcn/ui First**: Use only shadcn/ui components for consistency
2. **MVP Compatibility**: Never break existing functionality
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Features should degrade gracefully
4. **Mobile-First**: Design for mobile, enhance for desktop
5. **Accessibility**: Maintain WCAG compliance throughout

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy load enhancement features to maintain fast initial load
- Use React.Suspense for code splitting enhancement components
- Implement virtual scrolling for large file lists and leaderboards
- Cache frequently accessed data in localStorage
- Optimize images and files before upload

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all service methods and utility functions
- Integration tests for MVP compatibility
- End-to-end tests for complete user workflows
- Performance tests for file operations and real-time features
- Accessibility tests for all new components

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Setup Script Fails**: Verify Appwrite API key and permissions
- **File Upload Errors**: Check file size limits and storage bucket configuration
- **Real-time Updates Missing**: Verify WebSocket connections and subscriptions
- **Performance Issues**: Enable lite mode or disable animations

### Getting Help
1. Check the troubleshooting section in `docs/enhancement-foundation.md`
2. Review test files for usage examples
3. Consult Appwrite documentation for backend issues
