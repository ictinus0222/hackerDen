# HackerDen Enhancement Foundation

This document describes the foundation setup for HackerDen enhancement features, including file sharing, idea management, gamification, judge submissions, polling, and bot interactions.

## Overview

The enhancement foundation provides:

- **File Sharing System**: Upload, preview, and annotate team files
- **Idea Management**: Submit, vote on, and track team ideas
- **Gamification**: Points, achievements, and celebrations
- **Judge Submissions**: Public submission pages for hackathon judging
- **Polling System**: Team decision-making through polls
- **Bot Interactions**: Motivational messages and easter eggs

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Configuration

Ensure your `.env` file includes the required Appwrite configuration:

```env
VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=your-database-id
APPWRITE_API_KEY=your-server-api-key  # Required for setup script
```

### 2. Run Enhancement Setup

Execute the setup script to create all required collections and storage buckets:

```bash
npm run setup:enhancements
```

This script will create:

#### Database Collections
- `files` - File metadata and storage references
- `file_annotations` - Comments and annotations on files
- `ideas` - Team idea submissions
- `idea_votes` - Voting records for ideas
- `user_points` - Gamification point tracking
- `achievements` - User achievement records
- `submissions` - Hackathon judge submission data
- `polls` - Team polling system
- `poll_votes` - Poll voting records
- `reactions` - Emoji reactions for messages and tasks

#### Storage Buckets
- `team-files` - Team file uploads (10MB limit)
- `custom-emoji` - Custom emoji uploads (1MB limit)

### 3. Verify Setup

Run the enhancement tests to verify everything is working:

```bash
npm run test:run -- src/services/__tests__/enhancementServices.test.js
```

- Role-based permissions
- Audit trail for sensitive operations

### Data Privacy
- Submission URLs are public but unguessable
- Personal data encryption
- GDPR compliance considerations

## Integration Points

### MVP Integration
All enhancement services integrate with existing MVP systems:
- **Chat Integration**: Activity notifications in team chat
- **Task Integration**: Idea and poll conversion to tasks
- **Team Integration**: Team-scoped data and permissions
- **Real-time Integration**: Live updates across all features

### Real-time Features
- File upload notifications
- Idea voting updates
- Achievement celebrations
- Poll result updates
- Bot message delivery

## Development Workflow

### Adding New Features
1. Define data models in service files
2. Add collection definitions to setup script
3. Implement service methods with error handling
4. Add comprehensive tests
5. Document integration points

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all service methods
- Integration tests with MVP features
- Error handling validation
- Performance testing for file operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Setup Script Fails
- Verify environment variables are set
- Check Appwrite API key permissions
- Ensure database exists in Appwrite Console

#### File Upload Errors
- Check file size and type restrictions
- Verify storage bucket permissions
- Test network connectivity to Appwrite

#### Real-time Updates Not Working
- Verify Appwrite subscription configuration
- Check browser WebSocket support
- Test with multiple browser tabs

### Performance Optimization
- File compression for large uploads
- Lazy loading for file previews
- Pagination for large datasets
- Caching for frequently accessed data

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Advanced file preview (PDF viewer, code syntax highlighting)
- Team analytics and insights
- Advanced achievement system
- Custom bot personalities
- Integration with external tools

### Scalability Considerations
- File storage optimization
