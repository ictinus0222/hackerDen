  - Auto-hide functionality with progress bar
  - Manual dismissal with smooth animations
  - Proper accessibility with ARIA labels
  - Configurable maximum visible notifications
  - Slide-in animations from the right

### 4. GroupedNotificationSummary Component (`src/components/GroupedNotificationSummary.jsx`)

  - Group dismissal functionality
  - Shows notification counts per group
  - Limits expanded content to prevent UI overflow

## Integration Points

### ChatContainer Integration
- Added notification hooks to existing ChatContainer
- Integrated notification indicator in chat header

- Handles new message notifications automatically

### CSS Animations
- Added notification-specific animations to `src/index.css`:
  - `slide-in-right`: For notification entrance
  - `slide-up`: For subtle entrance effects
  - `shrink-width`: For progress bar animations
  - `bounce-subtle`: For attention-grabbing effects
- Responsive positioning for mobile and desktop

## Requirements Fulfilled

### ‚úÖ 6.1: Unread Message Indicators
- Implemented using shadcn/ui Badge component
- Shows count in chat header with animated bell icon
- Persists across page reloads using localStorage
- Automatically updates based on page visibility

- Fallback behavior for failed notification operations
- Retry mechanisms for critical notifications

## Testing
- Comprehensive test suite with 17 test cases
- Tests for all notification components and hooks
- Browser notification API mocking
- Accessibility testing with screen readers
- Edge case handling (large counts, multiple notifications)

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with Notification API support
- Graceful fallback for unsupported browsers
- Mobile-responsive design
- Touch-friendly interaction targets

## Future Enhancements
- Sound notifications for important updates
