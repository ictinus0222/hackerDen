## User Experience

### Editing Workflow
1. **Hover over task card** to reveal edit and delete buttons
2. **Click blue edit icon** to open edit modal
3. **Modify task details** as needed
4. **Update assignment** (team leaders only)
5. **Click "Update Task"** to save changes
6. **See immediate updates** across all team member devices

### Role-Based Experience

#### Team Leaders
- See dropdown with all team members for assignment
- Can edit any task in the team
- Assignment dropdown shows role indicators (Team Leader/Member)
- Full control over task assignment and details

#### Regular Members  
- Can edit tasks but see static assignment display
- Assignment remains with themselves (consistent with create flow)
- All other editing capabilities available
- Clear indication of assignment limitations

### Visual Design
- **Edit Button**: Blue color to distinguish from red delete button
- **Modal Header**: Dynamic title showing "Edit Task" vs "Create New Task"
- **Form Fields**: Pre-populated with existing task data
- **Submit Button**: Shows "Update Task" vs "Create Task"
- **Loading States**: Clear feedback during update operations

## Accessibility Features

### Keyboard Navigation

## Real-Time Synchronization

### Update Flow
1. User edits task in modal
2. Changes sent to Appwrite via `updateTaskFields()`
3. Real-time subscription detects update
4. All connected clients receive updated task data
5. UI updates automatically without page refresh

### Conflict Resolution
- Uses Appwrite's built-in conflict resolution
- Last-write-wins approach for simplicity
- Real-time updates prevent most conflicts
- Error handling for failed updates

## Error Handling

### Validation Errors
- Real-time form validation
- Clear error messages for required fields
- Visual indicators for invalid inputs
- Prevents submission of invalid data

### Network Errors
- Graceful handling of connection issues
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry mechanisms where appropriate
- Maintains form data during errors

### Permission Errors
- Role-based UI prevents unauthorized actions
- Server-side validation for additional security
- Clear feedback for permission issues
- Graceful degradation of functionality
