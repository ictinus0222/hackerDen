# Task Editing Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive task editing functionality for HackerDen MVP, including role-based assignment permissions and full CRUD operations for tasks.

## Implementation Details

### ✅ Components Modified

#### 1. TaskCard Component (`src/components/TaskCard.jsx`)
**Changes Made:**
- Added `onEdit` prop to component interface
- Added blue edit button alongside existing delete button
- Implemented hover state to show both edit and delete actions
- Added proper event handling to prevent drag conflicts
- Enhanced accessibility with ARIA labels and tooltips

**Key Features:**
- Edit button appears on hover with blue color (vs red delete)
- Proper spacing and visual hierarchy
- Accessibility compliant with keyboard navigation
- Touch-friendly for mobile devices

#### 2. TaskModal Component (`src/components/TaskModal.jsx`)
**Changes Made:**
- Added dual-mode functionality (create vs edit)
- Added `editTask`, `onTaskUpdated` props
- Enhanced form initialization to handle existing task data
- Updated submit handler to call appropriate service method
- Dynamic UI elements based on mode (title, buttons, etc.)

**Key Features:**
- Pre-populates form with existing task data when editing
- Dynamic modal title: "Create New Task" vs "Edit Task"
- Dynamic submit button: "Create Task" vs "Update Task"
- Maintains all existing validation and error handling
- Role-based assignment dropdown for team leaders

#### 3. TaskColumn Component (`src/components/TaskColumn.jsx`)
**Changes Made:**
- Added `onTaskEdit` prop to component interface
- Passed `onEdit` prop through to TaskCard components
- Maintained existing functionality while adding edit capability

#### 4. KanbanBoard Component (`src/components/KanbanBoard.jsx`)
**Changes Made:**
- Added `editingTask` state for tracking which task is being edited
- Added `handleTaskEdit` function to open edit modal
- Added `handleTaskUpdated` callback for edit completion
- Added `handleModalClose` for proper state cleanup
- Updated TaskModal props to include edit functionality

**Key Features:**
- Proper state management for edit vs create modes
- Integration with existing real-time update system
- Clean separation of create and edit workflows

### ✅ Service Integration

#### TaskService (`src/services/taskService.js`)
**Existing Method Used:**
- `updateTaskFields(taskId, updates)` - Updates task with new data
- Maintains compatibility with real-time subscriptions
- Proper error handling and validation

**Update Process:**
1. TaskModal calls `taskService.updateTaskFields()`
2. Appwrite database is updated
3. Real-time subscription detects change
4. All connected clients receive updated task data
5. UI updates automatically across all team members

### ✅ Role-Based Permissions

#### Team Leaders (Owner Role)
- **Task Assignment**: Can assign tasks to any team member
- **Edit Permissions**: Can edit any task in the team
- **Assignment Control**: See dropdown with all team members
- **Visual Indicators**: Dropdown shows role indicators (Team Leader/Member)

#### Regular Members
- **Task Assignment**: Can only assign tasks to themselves
- **Edit Permissions**: Can edit tasks (assignment stays with them)
- **Assignment Display**: See static display showing self-assignment
- **Consistent Experience**: Same editing capabilities except assignment

### ✅ User Experience Enhancements

#### Visual Design
- **Edit Button**: Blue color to distinguish from red delete button
- **Button Positioning**: Proper spacing and hover states
- **Modal Interface**: Clean, professional editing interface
- **Form Pre-population**: Existing data automatically loaded
- **Loading States**: Clear feedback during update operations

#### Accessibility
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for edit workflow
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- **Focus Management**: Modal traps focus and returns properly
- **Touch Targets**: Edit button meets minimum touch target size

#### Real-Time Synchronization
- **Immediate Updates**: Changes appear instantly for all team members
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately while server processes
- **Conflict Resolution**: Uses Appwrite's built-in conflict handling
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of failed updates
